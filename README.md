# Petcation

Petcation is a space for all pet lovers, owners and sitters alike. As pet owners, we often reach out to our closest, most trusted friends to care for our loving pets. Our friends are also happy to care for your pets when time permits for them. Without the pressure and obligation to ask (and respond), Petcation allows pet owners to post petcations. Our friends are then able to see available dates and respond to pet sit voluntarily. Most importantly, our loving pets get a chance to take a "petcation" with our friends!!
